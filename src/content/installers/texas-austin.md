Austin receives generous seasonal rainfall that can overwhelm storm drains during heavy downpours. Capturing that rainfall in thoughtfully designed systems helps homeowners offset municipal water use while reducing runoff that can stress the Colorado River watershed. Experienced local installers understand Central Texas weather patterns and recommend equipment built to withstand long summers and occasional drought conditions.

Most Austin systems start with rooftop catchment areas that channel water into first-flush diverters, filters, and food-grade cisterns sized for the property. From there, professional crews integrate pumps, UV or carbon filtration, and smart controls so households can irrigate landscapes, top off pools, or supply non-potable indoor fixtures with confidence. Both Lone Star Rainwater Solutions and GreenFlow Harvest Systems tailor designs for existing homes, new builds, and light commercial projects.

Homeowners ready for a consultation can call, email, or schedule a site visit through each installer’s website. Expect an initial assessment that covers roof square footage, annual rainfall averages, budget, and any architectural considerations. These teams also help with maintenance plans, from cleaning gutters and screens to testing pumps before peak storm season.

Austin residents may qualify for rebates from Austin Water’s Rainwater Harvesting Rebate Program, which offsets the cost of cisterns and related equipment. Ready to start collecting rainwater? Contact one of Austin’s trusted installers today.
