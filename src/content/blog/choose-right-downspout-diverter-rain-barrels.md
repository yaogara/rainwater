The downspout diverter is the small part that makes everything work. Choose one that fits your gutter, handles your rainfall, and simplifies maintenance.

Common diverter types

- In‑line drop‑in: Inserts into vertical downspout; easy retrofits; good for 50–200 gal barrels.
- Flexible hose kits: Simple installs; watch for kinks and UV aging.
- High‑flow in‑line boxes: Better for heavy rain and multiple barrels.
- Y‑diverters with shutoff: Manual control and easy winter bypass.

Fit matters: gutter shapes and sizes

- Round vs. rectangular: Match the kit to your profile; use manufacturer templates.
- 2×3 vs. 3×4 in.: Larger downspouts move more water; choose high‑flow diverters for 3×4.
- Fascia/space constraints: Slim diverters or offset fittings may be needed.

Right‑sizing for rainfall

- Estimate peak downspout flow by roof area feeding it and local rainfall intensity.
- For frequent heavy storms, prefer high‑flow diverters and large, screened overflows.

Installation tips

- Keep the barrel elevated for hose pressure and spigot access.
- Seal lids; add basket screens and first‑flush if possible.
- Route overflow away from foundations; equalize levels if daisy‑chaining barrels.

Winterizing

- Use Y‑diverter or seasonal caps to bypass the barrel.
- Drain barrels before freeze; store hoses and open valves.
