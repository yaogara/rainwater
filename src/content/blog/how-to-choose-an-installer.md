Selecting the right installer starts with confirming their certifications and experience with systems similar to yours. Ask for references, review photos of past installations, and confirm whether maintenance plans are offered. A reputable contractor will evaluate your roof area, rainfall, storage needs, and filtration requirements before recommending equipment. Use Rainwater Directory to compare verified providers, read summaries of their services, and find the best fit for your home.
