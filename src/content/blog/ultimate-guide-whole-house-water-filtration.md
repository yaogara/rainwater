Whole‑house filtration improves taste, protects plumbing, and—when paired with disinfection—can make rainwater suitable for broader uses. Here’s how common technologies fit together.

Core technologies

- Sediment filters: Remove particles (sand, silt, rust). Choose graded stages (50→20→5 µm) or single multi‑depth cartridge.
- Activated carbon (GAC/blocks): Reduce chlorine/chloramine, taste/odors, and many organics.
- Water softeners (ion exchange): Reduce hardness scale; not a filter. Regeneration needs salt and drain.
- Reverse osmosis (RO): Removes dissolved salts/metals; low flow and a waste stream; typically used at a tap, not whole‑house.
- UV disinfection: Inactivates microbes; requires low turbidity and sufficient UV dose.
- Chlorine/chloramine: Provides residual disinfection; common in municipal water and some private systems.

Typical configurations by source

- Municipal tap: Sediment → carbon; softener if hard; optional UV for sensitive use cases.
- Well water: Test first. Often sediment → carbon → softener; add specialty media for iron, sulfur, etc.; UV if microbes present.
- Rainwater (non‑potable whole‑house): Sediment → carbon to protect plumbing, plus labeling.
- Rainwater (potable where allowed): Sediment → carbon → UV or chlorine; maintain log and test periodically. See /blog/can-you-drink-rainwater-cdc-science.

Sizing and maintenance

- Flow rate: Size housings and media for peak gallons per minute (GPM) and desired pressure drop.
- Cartridge life: Track gallons or pressure differential; keep spares on hand.
- UV lamps: Replace annually; clean sleeves; ensure power protection.

Plumbing tips

- Add unions and bypass loops for service.
- Isolate non‑potable loops and label lines clearly.
- Protect from freezing; provide drainage for backwash and softener regeneration.
