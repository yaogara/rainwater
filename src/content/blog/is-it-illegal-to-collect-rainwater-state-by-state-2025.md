Quick answer: Rainwater harvesting is legal in every U.S. state in 2025. What varies are the rules on system design, potable use, permits, overflow management, and incentives. Use this guide to understand common rules, how to check your local code, and where to find rebates.

What most people want to know

- Is rainwater harvesting legal? Yes—in all 50 states.
- Can I drink it? Only after proper treatment and when local code allows. See /blog/can-you-drink-rainwater-cdc-science.
- Do I need a permit? Sometimes—for large tanks, underground cisterns, or plumbing tie-ins.
- Are there rebates? Many cities and utilities offer them. Check your state and local water utility.
- Where to verify? Start at your city/county permitting office and state environmental or plumbing code.

How states typically regulate rainwater

- Allowed with best practices (most states): Encourages non-potable uses (irrigation, toilet flushing) and basic safeguards (sealed lids, screened inlets, mosquito control).
- Allowed with plumbing/health code oversight: Potable uses require filtration and disinfection (e.g., sediment + carbon + UV). Backflow prevention is mandatory when connected to household plumbing.
- Special rules in arid/intermountain states: Colorado historically limited rooftop capture but now allows residential collection within clear limits; Utah and Arizona provide strong guidance and incentives for conservation.
- Incentives and stormwater programs: Rebates or fee reductions for reducing runoff and demand on municipal systems.

How to confirm your local rules (5‑minute checklist)

1) Find your jurisdiction: City + county + state. Some rural areas use county-level permitting.
2) Read the plumbing/health code section on “non-potable water” or “rainwater catchment.”
3) Check when permits are triggered: underground tanks, connections to toilets/laundry, pump installs, or electrical.
4) Verify potable rules: If allowed, understand minimum treatment (micron filtration, activated carbon, disinfection like UV or chlorine) and labeling requirements.
5) Ask about incentives: Utility rebates, stormwater fee credits, or green infrastructure programs.

People Also Ask (with straight answers)

- Is rainwater free to collect? Yes, but equipment and permits may cost money.
- Is it legal to drink rainwater? It can be, with proper treatment and where allowed by code. See /blog/can-you-drink-rainwater-cdc-science.
- Do rain barrels need screens? Yes—keep out mosquitoes and debris.
- Do I need a first‑flush diverter? Recommended to reduce roof dust, pollen, and bird droppings.
- Can I connect rainwater to toilets/laundry? Often yes, with permits, labeling, and backflow protection.

State-by-state snapshot (at a glance)

- Broadly permitted with guidance: CA, OR, WA, TX, FL, NC, VA, GA, NY, MA, etc.
- Potable use addressed in code: TX, WA, OR, HI, and many others (local enforcement varies).
- Distinct histories/nuance: CO, UT, AZ, NM (conservation emphasis, specific rules).
- Incentive-heavy locales: Many large metros and water-stressed regions; check /states and your city utility.

Compliance and good design principles

- Keep water dark, cool, and sealed; use opaque tanks with tight lids.
- Screen all inlets/overflows; route overflow away from foundations.
- Use a first‑flush diverter and leaf filters to reduce debris load.
- Label non‑potable lines; install backflow preventers where required.
- For potable systems, implement multi-stage filtration and disinfection; test water periodically.
