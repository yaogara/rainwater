Choosing the right tank depends on volume, location, budget, and whether the water is potable. Here are 10 common options and when they shine.

Quick picks by use case

- Emergency/portable (100–330 gal): Reconditioned IBC tote (food‑grade), small poly barrels.
- Budget irrigation (200–1000 gal): Rotomolded polyethylene (UV‑stabilized) above‑ground tanks.
- Aesthetic/compact: Slimline or decorative polyethylene.
- Large above‑ground (2500–5000+ gal): Corrugated steel with liner; modular and scalable.
- Underground, long life: Concrete or fiberglass cisterns.
- Low‑clearance/indoor crawlspace: Bladder tanks.

Tank types (pros/cons)

1) Polyethylene (rotomolded)
- Pros: Affordable, many sizes, simple install; potable models available.
- Cons: UV exposure ages plastic; needs stable pad and sun protection.

2) Slimline/decorative poly
- Pros: Fits tight spaces, better curb appeal.
- Cons: Usually higher cost per gallon; limited large sizes.

3) Corrugated steel with liner
- Pros: Scales to very large volumes; strong; serviceable liner replacement.
- Cons: Higher upfront cost; requires flat pad; aesthetic/HOA considerations.

4) Fiberglass (above or underground)
- Pros: Durable, inert; good for underground installs.
- Cons: Cost; may require professional install.

5) Concrete cistern (underground)
- Pros: Long service life; buffers pH; traffic‑rated options.
- Cons: Heavy equipment, excavation, and permitting.

6) Bladder tank
- Pros: Fits crawlspaces; low profile; fast to deploy.
- Cons: Requires protective surface; puncture risk; limited very large sizes.

7) Reconditioned IBC tote (275–330 gal)
- Pros: Widely available; inexpensive per gallon.
- Cons: Verify food‑grade and prior contents; add opaque cover to block light.

8) Galvanized steel (lined vs. unlined)
- Pros: Rugged; farmhouse aesthetic.
- Cons: Unlined tanks not for potable storage; corrosion concerns.

9) Modular plastic panels/cells
- Pros: Hidden under decks/landscapes; customizable shapes.
- Cons: Installation complexity; geotextile/liner details matter.

10) Wooden tanks with liners
- Pros: Unique look; replaceable liners.
- Cons: Maintenance; not common in all regions.

Buyer’s checklist

- Potable rating and documentation (if drinking).
- Opaque walls, sealed lids, screened vents/overflows.
- Pad/foundation requirements and seismic/wind loads.
- Fittings, unions, and future service access.
- Freeze, sun, and algae mitigation strategies.
