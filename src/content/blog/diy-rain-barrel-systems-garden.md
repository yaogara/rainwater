Rain barrels are the fastest, lowest‑cost way to start harvesting rainwater for gardens and planters. This guide covers parts, setup, and common mistakes to avoid.

What you’ll need (typical 50–100 gal)

- Food‑grade barrel or purpose‑made tank (opaque, threaded bung)
- Downspout diverter sized to your gutter: /blog/choose-right-downspout-diverter-rain-barrels
- Inlet screen, sealed lid, mosquito dunk (as allowed)
- Bulkhead fittings (1/2"–3/4") + hose bibb/spigot
- Overflow fitting and hose routed away from foundation
- Cinder blocks or stand to raise outlet height

Build steps (afternoon project)

1) Place the barrel on a stable, level stand; water is heavy (8.34 lbs/gal).
2) Install the spigot near the bottom using a bulkhead fitting; hand‑tighten and test.
3) Add an overflow port near the top with a screened hose leading away from the house.
4) Fit a leaf screen or basket under the lid; keep it sealed to block mosquitoes.
5) Install a downspout diverter per instructions; match gutter shape/size.
6) Test during a light rain: confirm fill, overflow, and no leaks into the foundation.

Smart upgrades

- First‑flush kit to reduce roof debris.
- Quick‑connect hose fittings and shutoff valves.
- Daisy‑chain barrels with balanced overflows and equalized outlets.
- Opaque paint or barrel wrap to minimize algae in sunny locations.

Seasonal care

- Freeze protection: Drain before hard freezes or use freeze‑proof diverters.
- Clean screens and rinse barrel 1–2× per season.
- Keep lid sealed; refresh mosquito control as allowed.

Costs (typical)

- Barrel: $50–$180 depending on size and material.
- Diverter kit: $30–$70.
- Fittings/stand/misc.: $30–$80.

What not to do

- Don’t leave barrels open—stagnant water breeds mosquitoes.
- Don’t discharge overflow at the foundation; route to landscaping or a safe drain.
- Don’t use for drinking without a compliant treatment system and local approval.
