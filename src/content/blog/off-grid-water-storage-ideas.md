Off‑grid storage ranges from quick‑deploy totes to permanent cisterns. Here’s how popular options compare and how to keep water safer.

At‑a‑glance options

- 5–55 gal: Stackable jugs/barrels; rotate stock; good for vans and short trips.
- 100–330 gal: IBC totes (verify food‑grade); fast setup; cover to block light.
- 500–2500 gal: Above‑ground poly or slimline tanks; affordable per gallon.
- 2500–10,000+ gal: Corrugated steel with liner; farm/ranch or whole‑house scale.
- Underground cisterns: Concrete/fiberglass; high capacity with minimal visual impact.

Key considerations

- Potable vs. utility: Choose potable‑rated tanks for drinking; keep dark and cool.
- Freeze: Drain or bury; insulate and add heat where needed.
- Access: Plan fill points, hose bibbs, and sample ports.
- Redundancy: Pair storage with filtration/disinfection and backup power for pumps.

Popular setups

- Cabin utility loop: Roof → pre‑screen → tank → sediment/carbon → hose bibbs for cleaning/irrigation.
- Potable off‑grid (where allowed): Add UV or chlorine and a pressure system; keep a maintenance log. See /blog/ultimate-guide-whole-house-water-filtration.
- Mobile rigs: Secure IBC tote with proper tie‑downs; vent and splash guards.

Safety tips

- Label non‑potable lines; avoid cross‑connections.
- Opaque tanks, sealed lids, screened vents/overflows.
- Test water periodically if drinking; rotate emergency stores every 6–12 months.
